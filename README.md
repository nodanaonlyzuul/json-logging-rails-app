# JSON Logging Rails App

This is a Rails application that spits out logs.  
There are many like it, but this one it mine.  
It's a good app to deploy to ElasticBeanstalk if one if interested in showing off building:

* Filters from logs =>  
* Metrics from filters =>  
* Alarms  from Metrics =>  
* Alerts from Alarms =>

That's it dude.
